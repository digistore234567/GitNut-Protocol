# Audits

This folder tracks security review artifacts.

- `internal/`: internal reviews, checklists, threat model deltas
- `third-party/`: vendor assessments, public audit reports, and remediation notes

Recommended practice:
- Every release should record:
  - commit hash
  - IDL hash
  - schema version
  - storage manifest hash
  - attestation public keys used for signing
